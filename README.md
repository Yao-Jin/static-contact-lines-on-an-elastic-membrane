# contact-lines-on-an-elastic-membrane
This website provides the codes and data for the paper  **"Static interface profiles for contact lines on an elastic membrane"**.

The folder **codes** contains the MATLAB functions/scripts for the numerical method proposed in the paper:

     main.m is the driver;
     
     reshape_droplet.m computes the droplet profile for given contact points and area;
     
     update_membrane.m computes the memebrane profile;
     
     move_contactline.m updates the contact line position on the membrane.

The folder **data** contains the data for **Figures 3-5** in the paper.

The folder **tools** contains MATLAB programs which produce the figures using the data.
